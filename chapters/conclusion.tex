\chapter{Conclusion}

In this project, we developed a framework for the training of attention based CNN models to detect
elbow fractures from X-rays. The framework was validated by training 3 attentione based CNN models as well 
as an ensemble model using feature fusion. The results showed that the framework achieved a significant improvement over 
the baseline models. In addition, we finetuned 2 VLMs, MedGemma and LLaVA-Rad, on the same dataset and found that LLaVA-Rad had
competitive performance compared to the attention based CNNs. Lastly, we suggested possible ways to improve on the performance
of the CNNs and VLMs.
