\section{Dataset}
\label{imp:sec:Dataset}

\begin{flushleft}
The main dataset used in this project consists of 4369 elbow radiographs in either the lateral or anterior posterior view. (insert origin)
Each radiograph is labelled as either positive (untreated fracture and/or dislocation) or negative. The dataset was further split into 
training, validation, and test sets using a 80/10/10 split as shown in figure 3.1.

In addition, the MURA dataset from Stanford Machine Learning Group was used for pretraining. This dataset consists of 40561 radiographs of 7 
different bodyparts: elbow, finger, forearm, hand, humerus, shoulder and wrist. Each image is labelled as either positive (abnormality) 
or negative (no abnormality).
